"""Application services (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §15).

The only layer allowed to join every stage (plan §5.3 rule 5): it composes
``validation``, ``variants``, ``transform``, ``serialize``, ``output``,
``persistence``, and the model itself into the workflows a UI or CLI
drives. Services never raise for user-caused problems — they return
result values (``results.py``) whose ``ok`` flag is the contract.

The layer owns no domain logic: every stage's invariants live in the
stage's own package; this package only sequences them.
