"""The console entry point (plan §5 architecture map: one console entry point;
packaging declared in ``pyproject.toml`` as ``configbuilder.app.cli:main``).

This module is the **composition root** of the console application, not an
application-domain module: it builds the standard service wiring once, hands
it to the free-navigation builder (``ui.render.menus.MenuApp``), and returns
the session status. The guided wizard stays reachable from the builder's
menu (option 7) — nothing here duplicates either front end.

Importing ``ui`` from here is the single, designated exception to plan §5.3
rule 6: an entry point is a composition root, not an ordinary ``app`` module.
``tests/architecture/test_dependency_rules.py`` names this module explicitly
as the only such exception and guards what it may import.
