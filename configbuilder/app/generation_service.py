"""Generation (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §15): ``GenerationService``.

The generation sequence is fixed in exactly one place, in this order:

1. Expand variants.
2. Transform each variant.
3. Encode each wire document.
4. Build the output plan, including collision detection and the manifest
   payload.

The gate runs ``ValidationService.GATE_TIERS`` — structural, relational,
contract and preflight — over the base before anything is expanded, and the
full catalogue (including the variant drift/identity comparison) over every
selected variant before anything is written. Every one of those checks is
decidable in-process: validation does not run AF3 and never consults a
prediction, result directory or completion marker, so a valid configuration
is saved and generated without ever having been executed.

Save, preview and generation run the same gate, and readiness on the Overview
reads it too, so no surface can say "ready" while another refuses.

Everything before ``execute`` is pure planning (plan §13.3): nothing is
written without a plan, and ``execute`` performs writes only — it does
not re-derive content, so what the user reviewed is exactly what is
written. The service returns result objects and writes nothing itself
(plan §5.3 rule 8: filesystem access is confined to ``output`` and
``persistence``).

Two wire-level agreements happen between steps 2 and 3, both through
``transform`` so wire vocabulary never leaks into ``app`` (plan §10.1):

- the job ``name`` field carries the same derived name the directory
  and filename use (plan §13.2) — via ``transform.with_wire_job_name``;
- external resource paths are rewritten to their emitted forms (§13.5
  path policies) — via ``transform.with_emitted_resource_paths``.

The manifest joins the plan as an ordinary planned file (§13.1): same
overwrite policy, atomic write, part of the reviewed layout. Its
``validation_summary`` records the combined base-plus-variant report the
gate produced for exactly the configurations written — and stays empty
when no validator is wired, never inventing a clean run.
