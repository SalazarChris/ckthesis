"""Where output goes, and where the user's choices are remembered.

This module is the single answer to "what folder should the save/generate
default be?". Both front ends ask it, so the console and the window cannot
disagree, and nothing here reads the current working directory: the defaults
are the same whether the application was started from Explorer, a shortcut,
a terminal in the application folder, or a terminal in ``C:\\Windows``.

Resolution order for the **output root** (``resolve_root``):

1. ``AF3BUILDER_OUTPUT_ROOT`` — an explicit configuration. A value that
   cannot be created or written is reported as a diagnostic and the next
   source is used; it is never silently accepted *or* silently dropped.
2. a remembered root from the preferences file, when it is still usable;
3. ``<Documents>/AF3Builder``;
4. ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\AF3Builder`` when Documents is unavailable.

Two subdirectories keep the operations apart, because they are different
things: ``generated_configurations`` for batch output (one configuration per
input entry plus ``manifest.json`` and asset copies) and ``saved_jobs`` for a
single saved job and its ``assets/``. Each also remembers its own last-used
directory, so a user who exports to a network share is not dragged back to
Documents on the next save.

Preferences live in ``%APPDATA%\\AF3Builder\\preferences.json`` — user-writable,
outside the installation folder, and safe to lose: every read tolerates a
missing, malformed or partially valid file and falls back to the defaults.
Nothing in this module raises for a user-caused problem, and nothing imports
the UI layer (plan §5.3: ``app`` never imports ``ui``).
