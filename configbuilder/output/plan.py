"""The output planner (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §13.1, §13.3, §13.5).

``plan`` is pure: no writes, no clock, no randomness — the same inputs
yield the same plan. It turns (name payloads, resource requirements,
policies, a read-only view of the filesystem) into the full list of
intended paths with their actions and payload fingerprints. The review
step shows this plan before anything is written; nothing is ever written
without a plan.

Actions (§13.3): ``create`` (target absent), ``overwrite`` (target exists;
same bytes, or policy Overwrite), ``skip`` (policy Skip), ``conflict``
(policy Fail and target holds different bytes). ``Versioned`` is resolved
at plan time to the actual suffixed path (deterministic numeric suffix),
so the plan always shows the real final layout.

This layer has no contract logic and no validation (plan §5.3 rule 4):
inputs are plain data — byte payloads, name strings, raw resource paths —
and the filesystem is reached only through the read-only ``FileView`` port
so planning is testable without a disk. Cross-machine hazards (absolute
resource paths) are collected as warnings, which the caller surfaces
through the normal validation/preflight reporting — planning reports,
it does not validate.
