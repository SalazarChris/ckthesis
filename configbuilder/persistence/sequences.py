"""Sequence-list and SMILES file reading — batch-variant input adapters.

Filesystem access is confined to ``output`` and ``persistence`` (plan
§5.3 rule 8), so the batch-variant feature reads its input files here
and ``app`` stays IO-free.

Supported formats:

**Sequence files (.txt):**
  One biological sequence per line (protein, DNA, RNA):
  - blank (or whitespace-only) lines are ignored;
  - surrounding whitespace on a line is stripped;
  - Windows and Unix line endings both work (text mode + ``splitlines``);
  - comments are deliberately **not** part of the format: a ``#`` line is
    simply a line that will fail sequence validation, reported with its
    line number like any other invalid entry.

**SMILES files (.smiles or .txt):**
  One ligand per line, with optional name:
  - Format 1 (name + SMILES): ``<name> <SMILES>`` (name and SMILES separated by whitespace)
  - Format 2 (SMILES only): ``<SMILES>`` (no name, auto-generated)
  - blank lines are ignored;
  - lines starting with ``#`` are treated as comments and ignored;
  - surrounding whitespace is stripped.

**CCD code files (.txt):**
  One ligand per line, given as component code(s):
  - a line's tokens (whitespace, commas or semicolons) are the components of
    **one** ligand, the contract's multi-component form
    (``NAG NAG BMA MAN MAN``);
  - blank lines and ``#`` comment lines are ignored;
  - surrounding whitespace is stripped, interior separators are not touched.

Reading never interprets a sequence, SMILES or component code — validation
belongs to the model, applied by the caller (``VariantService``). This module
only turns file bytes into numbered, cleaned entries.
