"""Presence algebra application at the wire boundary (plan §10.2).

The model's ``Unset | ExplicitEmpty | Present`` states reach the wire as
distinct structures:

==================  ==================================================
canonical state     wire emission
==================  ==================================================
``Unset``           field omitted from the entity object
``ExplicitEmpty``   field present with the contract's empty value
``Present(value)``  field present with the converted value
==================  ==================================================

``None`` never crosses this module's output: an omitted field is *absent
from the mapping*, not present-with-null. That is the whole point of the
presence algebra (spec §6.2, §6.3).
