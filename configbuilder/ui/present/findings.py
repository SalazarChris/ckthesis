"""Finding formatting (plan §16.6, §18.8 formatting tier).

Findings are grouped by severity, then by the record a ``FieldPath``
points to, each carrying a stable reference number the user can type to
jump straight to that field's prompt. Severity is a word and a symbol;
technical details are held behind a per-finding key rather than printed
inline. Finding text comes from the rule messages — no internal names,
no wire field names (plan §18.8: the meta-test enforces it).
