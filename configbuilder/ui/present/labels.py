"""Labels (plan §5.3 rule 6, §16.1, §18.8 formatting tier).

Every user-visible label resolves through the model's traceability
registry — the single translation point between neutral internal names
and human-facing wording (plan §3). Nothing here hard-codes a label; a
string that is neither registry wording nor rule message wording is a
defect the meta-test catches.

This module imports ``model.traceability`` only: ``ui`` may import
``app`` and ``model.traceability`` (plan §5.3 rule 6), and ``present``
is the family whose whole job is label resolution.
