"""The file-generation workflow's dialogs: kind, file, folder, review, result.

Five dumb steps, in the order the workflow asks them:

- :func:`choose_batch_kind` — what the file holds (protein, DNA, RNA, SMILES
  ligands, CCD-coded ligands), the one question content cannot answer;
- :func:`choose_batch_file` — the native open dialog for the input list, with
  the filter of the kind already chosen;
- :func:`choose_output_folder` — the native folder dialog for the outputs;
- :func:`confirm_batch_preview` — one box listing what was read, that kind, and
  where it will be written, before anything is planned or written;
- :func:`report_batch_run` — the outcome: the files that were written, or the
  service's own refusal.

Like every other dialog here they render wording and return an answer. None of
them reads a molecule, calls a service, decides a file name or writes anything:
the page owns that sequence, and the service owns every decision behind it.
