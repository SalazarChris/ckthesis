"""VARIANT-tier rule checks (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §12.5, §9.2).

These rules compare a variant against its base. Plan §5.3 rule 2 keeps
``validation`` and ``transform`` independent, so the comparison inputs are
handed over as plain data through ``ValidationContext``:

- ``context.variant_documents`` — mapping of variant key to that variant's
  wire document (built by ``app`` via ``transform``);
- ``context.base_document`` — the base's wire document;
- ``context.variant_declared_changes`` — mapping of variant key to the
  ``(factor, detail)`` pairs ``variants.declared_changes`` derived from the
  spec (``detail`` is the record key where the edit targets one);
- ``context.variant_registries`` — mapping of variant key to the variant's
  own ``IdentityRegistry`` (for identity stability).

Where the context lacks the facts, the rule reports "not checked" as a
WARNING rather than pretending the variant is clean (plan §9.6: a check
that could not run is *reported*, never silently green). The engine runs
base-level validation with a plain context, so these rules simply report
their skip condition there — base validation is not variant validation.
