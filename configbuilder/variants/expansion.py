"""Variant expansion (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §12.2, §12.3, §12.4).

``expand(base, specs, base_fingerprint) -> tuple[Variant, ...]`` is a pure
function: same base, same specs, same fingerprint — same variants, same
order. The fingerprint of the base's wire document arrives as *data*
(plan §5.3 rule 2 keeps ``variants`` and ``transform`` independent; ``app``
computes it and passes it in), and travels on every ``Lineage`` so a
manifest can prove which base a variant came from.

Isolation is structural (plan §12.4): model objects are frozen, so
sub-objects are shared between base and variants safely; edits return new
configurations; and any edit that would mutate the registry
(``AddRecord``/``RemoveRecord``) clones the registry first, so the base's
registry is never drained and siblings never see each other's
identifier changes. Released identifiers stay retired within each
variant's own registry generation (plan §8.3).
