"""Root-level launcher for the optional PySide6 desktop front end.

PySide6 is deliberately *not* a dependency of the core package, so the
desktop front end lives in its own environment (``.venv-gui``, created from
the ``gui`` extra). This launcher is the one-line bridge between the plain
project interpreter and that environment::

    python gui.py                       # empty window -> "Open AF3 JSON..."
    python gui.py --demo                # built-in sample job
    python gui.py "C:\\path\\to\\job with spaces.json"
    python gui.py --help

It runs the existing module ``configbuilder.ui.render.qt`` (never a
re-implementation of it) as::

    <repo-root>\\.venv-gui\\Scripts\\python.exe -m configbuilder.ui.render.qt <your args...>

Every argument is forwarded unchanged, as its own list element, with no
shell involved, so a JSON path containing spaces stays a single argument.
The child starts with the repository root as its working directory, so the
command behaves identically whether it is typed here or run by full path
from somewhere else.

If ``.venv-gui`` has not been created yet the launcher prints copyable setup
commands and exits non-zero *without* trying to start anything. It never
falls back to another interpreter, never installs anything, and never edits
the GUI itself -- a missing dependency is reported with the child's own
diagnostic and its exit code.
